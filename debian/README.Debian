nullmailer for Debian
----------------------

Current config does no logging.  If you wish to change this, edit the init.d
script and redirect output elsewhere:

case "$1" in
    start)
        echo -n "Starting mail-transport-agent: nullmailer"
        sh -c "start-stop-daemon --start --quiet -c mail \
                --exec /usr/sbin/nullmailer-send > /dev/null 2>&1 &"

(change /dev/null in the above line to the file you want to log to)

This package is best run using the daemontools package by Dan Bernstein, 
which you can get at http://cr.yp.to.  You can also download a daemontools
source package from http://flounder.net/debs/.  Future versions of this
package may support daemontools, but this one currently doesn't.

Due to the way Debian handles the domainname() call, it is recommended that you manually set the system's domain name using sysctl.  Add the following line to 
your /etc/sysctl.conf file and run sysctl -p:

kernel.domainname=<your domain name here>
